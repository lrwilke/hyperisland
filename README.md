# Data Analysis Workshop

Workshop conducted for [Hyper Island](https://www.hyperisland.com/).

Goal of the workshop was to introduce Data Analyst students to basic concepts of data manipulation and analysis using a notebook and Python (Pandas).

The `data` folder contains a number of files exported from the Swedish health authorities related to the spread of Covid-19 in the country. There are some intentional mistakes in the dataset. The files are imported, cleaned, and processed as part of the notebook.
